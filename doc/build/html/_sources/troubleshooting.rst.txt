Troubleshooting
===============

1. Missing configuration files:
   Ensure both `system_config.sh` and the ROI configuration file are present.

2. MATLAB path not found:
   Update `MATLAB_PATH` in `system_config.sh`.

3. Command not found:
   Verify that `fsl_sub` and `probtrackx` are installed and accessible from your system's PATH.
